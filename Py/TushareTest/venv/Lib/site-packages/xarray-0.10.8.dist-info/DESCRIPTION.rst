**xarray** (formerly **xray**) is an open source project and Python package
that aims to bring the labeled data power of pandas_ to the physical sciences,
by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.

Our goal is to provide a pandas-like and pandas-compatible toolkit for
analytics on multi-dimensional arrays, rather than the tabular data for which
pandas excels. Our approach adopts the `Common Data Model`_ for self-
describing scientific data in widespread use in the Earth sciences:
``xarray.Dataset`` is an in-memory representation of a netCDF file.
