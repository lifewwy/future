        =========
        
        Problem
        -------
        
        Buildout and mr.developer play nice together, until Cython join the party.
        There are no unified way to detect/use Cython, some of them (``gevent``) just
        use ``cython`` command from ``PATH`` or from ``CYTHON`` environment variable,
        others just try to import ``Cython`` modules directly from ``setup.py``.
        
        Solution
        --------
        
        Add ``mr.cython`` to the ``extensions`` entry in your ``[buildout]``
        section::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions = mr.cython
        
        If you use ``mr.developer``, add ``mr.cython`` right after them::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions =
              mr.developer
              mr.cython
        
        This implicitly install ``cython`` into your ``bin/`` directory, and allow 
        ``setup.py`` from subsequent developed packages find ``cython`` in path, and
        allow import ``Cython.*`` namespace from them. Only eggs from ``develop``
        line of ``[buildout]`` are affected, including eggs pulled by ``mr.developer``.
